Pointer arithmetic with differnt types (++ adds size of type)
	- Cast to uint8_t to add bytes

Global memory is initialized to 0
	- Stack & Heap is not

Make hash tables power of 2 num buckets
	- allows you to do a power of 2 - 1, intead of % operation in hash func
	- Work into conversation about hash tables

Test odd/even is just var &1
Toggle bool var ^=1

!!var sets any int to 1 or 0, depending if it was on or not.

Mem alignment

Don't mix malloc with delete or new with free

Talk about threading if it comes up

Smart Ptrs
	- manage heap memory

Convert from base 10/16 to base 9
	- write a function to do it

DONE* Finding intersection between 2 lists
	- 2 lists contain partially the same data set

DONE* Concept of shared Memory
